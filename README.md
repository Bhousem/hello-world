# hello-world
My first repository
This is my first attempt at using github, I am still learning the ropes
I would like to improve my knowledge in both R and Python
That would be Ideal
This is still part of the tutorial

This is a line from Rstudio wup wup

This is a second line from RStudio, I AM VERY GOOD AT CODING

This is a third and for today final line from RStudio, RSussudio

And this is the real third line
